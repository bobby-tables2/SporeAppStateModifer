# SporeAppStateModifier 

This mod adds five new cheats to Spore:

* enterEditor lets you load into any editor. (filenames of .prop files in editor_setup~)
* editCreation lets you load into any editor with any creation.
* aliasList lists all aliases for the previous two cheats.
* enterState lets you load into any app state. (animations~/SporeAppStates.trigger)
* enterMode lets you load into any game mode.

This fork was made for the sake of digging through unused content in Spore, not guaranteed to work properly.
